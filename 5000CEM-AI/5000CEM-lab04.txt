5000CEM Lab 4 - Introduction to Machine Learning

Basic Tasks - Intro to ML

a) Machine learning is a mechanism to give machine some data to decide which one it is. 
Thus, we need to use big and appropriate data for better results. 
There has been a suddent growth because companies has been learning how to use these data to their benefits.
For example, if you search something to buy, you are going to see a lot of adds related to that.
Because, they know that you want to buy this, so they are trying to convince you to buy with showing some discounts.
Also, it uses for face recognition. Therefore, CCTVs helps people to decide which person is on the CCTV at specific time.
Besides that, it also can be used to unlock phone screens. Therefore, nobody can not unlock specific phone except owner.
In addition to all of them, there are many applications such as self-driving cars, natural language processing and so on.

b) We use some data to teach machine how it needs to behave. It is called as training data set. 
When we taught to machine, we need to check that it is right or not. 
So, we use some validation data set to validate that we have taught to machine properly.
Then, we have test data set which is used for estimating with using all of the information that we taught.

c) TODO: Briefly outline in no more than 150 words what neural networks and
decision trees are. Ensure you indicate where they are appropriate
to use.
